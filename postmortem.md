Postmortem — Cursor-Coded Trading Approach

1. Hypothesis
Automating setups generated by ChatGPT through Cursor coding would create a scalable edge in trading.

2. Process
	•	Converted suggested setups into executable code.
	•	Integrated with CoinbaseService and logging.
	•	Ran live tests with fixed SL/TP structures.
	•	Iterated through multiple versions, tweaking logic and filters.

3. Results
	•	Execution worked, but performance remained inconsistent.
	•	Complexity increased faster than clarity.
	•	Emotional load and uncertainty rose with each iteration.
	•	No durable improvement in equity curve.

4. Failure Modes
	•	Overfitting: Adjustments tailored to short-term noise.
	•	Unproven edge: No strong manual baseline before coding.
	•	SL/TP issues: Far or static stops distorted R/R.
	•	Scope creep: Layering features before mastering basics.
	•	Emotional cost: Energy drained without clear returns.

5. Lessons
	•	Automation multiplies clarity or confusion—without a tested edge, it magnifies waste.
	•	Simpler, smaller tests provide faster signal.
	•	Frozen rules + measured outcomes beat constant tinkering.
	•	Capture metrics first, code later.
