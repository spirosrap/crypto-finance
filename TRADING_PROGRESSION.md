# Trading Progression Guide

## Step 1: Moving from Sandbox to Real Trading

### Initial Sandbox Testing (Completed)
- Started with $50 in sandbox environment
- Used 5x leverage for testing
- Focused on understanding system mechanics and risk management
- Verified trade execution and position management
- Tested various market conditions and strategies

### Step 1: Real Trading Implementation
- Initial capital: $100
- Leverage: 5x
- Position sizing: $100 per trade (full account)
- Position value with leverage: $500 (5x)
- Fixed stop loss: 0.7% of position value ($3.50)
- Maximum risk per trade: $3.50 (0.7% of $500)

### Key Considerations for Step 1
1. **Risk Management**
   - Fixed stop loss at 0.7% of position value ($3.50)
   - Use take-profit targets to lock in gains
   - Only one position at a time due to full account usage
   - Close position before opening new one
   - Monitor margin requirements closely

2. **Trading Parameters**
   - Start with conservative settings
   - Use same timeframe as tested in sandbox
   - Begin with manual trading before enabling auto-trading
   - Monitor system performance closely
   - Ensure sufficient margin for position maintenance

3. **Performance Tracking**
   - Document all trades
   - Track win/loss ratio
   - Monitor drawdown
   - Calculate risk-adjusted returns
   - Record entry/exit prices and timing
   - Track stop loss hits and their frequency

4. **Progression Criteria**
   - Must achieve consistent profitability for at least 2 weeks
   - Maximum drawdown should not exceed 10%
   - Win rate should be above 55%
   - System should handle different market conditions effectively
   - Must demonstrate ability to manage full account positions
   - Stop loss should not be hit more than 40% of trades

## Scaling Ladder (System-Proven Path)

This scaling ladder provides a systematic approach to growing account size and exposure as performance metrics are achieved.

| Step | Margin | Leverage | Exposure | Target Profit (5-10%) | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Start | $50 | 5x | $250 | $12-25/month | System sandbox â€” no expectations |
| Step 1 | $100 | 5x | $500 | $25-50/month | Stability check, tiny slippage impact |
| Step 2 | $250 | 5x | $1,250 | $62-125/month | Emotional friction starts here |
| Step 3 | $500 | 5x | $2,500 | $125-250/month | Small mistakes start to hurt |
| Step 4 | $1,000 | 5x | $5,000 | $250-500/month | Minimum viable lifestyle begins |
| Step 5 | $2,000 | 5x | $10,000 | $500-1,000/month | System must handle scale stress |
| Step 6 | $5,000 | 5x | $25,000 | $1,250-2,500/month | Tokyo tier, full-time freedom path |

### Progression Guidelines:
- Only move to the next step after consistently achieving target profit for at least one month
- Maintain the same risk parameters as account size increases
- Review and adjust the trading system at each step to ensure it scales appropriately
- Be aware that psychological challenges increase with position size
- System must prove stability before moving to steps where mistakes become costly
- Target profit range represents 5-10% monthly return on exposure amount

### Next Steps
- After successful completion of Step 1 (minimum 2 weeks)
- Review performance metrics
- If criteria are met, consider moving to Step 2
- If criteria are not met, analyze and adjust strategy

### Important Notes
- This is a real money account - treat it with appropriate seriousness
- Keep detailed records of all trades and decisions
- Be prepared to stop and reassess if performance deviates significantly from sandbox results
- Remember that real market conditions may differ from sandbox environment
- With full account usage per trade, position management is critical
- Ensure proper margin maintenance to avoid liquidation
- Fixed 0.7% stop loss means consistent risk per trade 
- Implementation of additional filters reduced trading frequency but significantly improved trade quality by avoiding potential traps
