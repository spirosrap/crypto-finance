# Trading Progression Guide

## Step 1: Moving from Sandbox to Real Trading

### Initial Sandbox Testing (Completed)
- Started with $50 in sandbox environment
- Used 5x leverage for testing
- Focused on understanding system mechanics and risk management
- Verified trade execution and position management
- Tested various market conditions and strategies

### Step 1: Real Trading Implementation
- Initial capital: $100
- Leverage: 5x
- Position sizing: $100 per trade (full account)
- Position value with leverage: $500 (5x)
- Fixed stop loss: 0.7% of position value ($3.50)
- Maximum risk per trade: $3.50 (0.7% of $500)

### Key Considerations for Step 1
1. **Risk Management**
   - Fixed stop loss at 0.7% of position value ($3.50)
   - Use take-profit targets to lock in gains
   - Only one position at a time due to full account usage
   - Close position before opening new one
   - Monitor margin requirements closely

2. **Trading Parameters**
   - Start with conservative settings
   - Use same timeframe as tested in sandbox
   - Begin with manual trading before enabling auto-trading
   - Monitor system performance closely
   - Ensure sufficient margin for position maintenance

3. **Performance Tracking**
   - Document all trades
   - Track win/loss ratio
   - Monitor drawdown
   - Calculate risk-adjusted returns
   - Record entry/exit prices and timing
   - Track stop loss hits and their frequency

4. **Progression Criteria**
   - Must achieve consistent profitability for at least 2 weeks
   - Maximum drawdown should not exceed 10%
   - Win rate should be above 55%
   - System should handle different market conditions effectively
   - Must demonstrate ability to manage full account positions
   - Stop loss should not be hit more than 40% of trades

### Next Steps
- After successful completion of Step 1 (minimum 2 weeks)
- Review performance metrics
- If criteria are met, consider moving to Step 2
- If criteria are not met, analyze and adjust strategy

### Important Notes
- This is a real money account - treat it with appropriate seriousness
- Keep detailed records of all trades and decisions
- Be prepared to stop and reassess if performance deviates significantly from sandbox results
- Remember that real market conditions may differ from sandbox environment
- With full account usage per trade, position management is critical
- Ensure proper margin maintenance to avoid liquidation
- Fixed 0.7% stop loss means consistent risk per trade
