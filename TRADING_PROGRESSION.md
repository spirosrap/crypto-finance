# Trading Progression Guide

## Step 1: Moving from Sandbox to Real Trading

### Initial Sandbox Testing (Completed)
- Started with $50 in sandbox environment
- Used 5x leverage for testing
- Focused on understanding system mechanics and risk management
- Verified trade execution and position management
- Tested various market conditions and strategies
- Documented successful patterns and failure points

### Step 1: Real Trading Implementation
- Initial capital: $100
- Leverage: 5x
- Position sizing: $100 per trade (full account)
- Position value with leverage: $500 (5x)
- Fixed stop loss: 0.7% of position value ($3.50)
- Maximum risk per trade: $3.50 (0.7% of $500)

### Key Considerations for Step 1
- Maintain detailed trade journal
- Track win/loss ratio and average profit/loss
- Monitor emotional response to real money trading

- Scale position size based on account growth
- Adjust leverage based on market volatility
- Consider correlation between positions

### Stop Loss Strategy
- Use ATR-based stops for volatility adjustment
- Implement trailing stops for winning trades
- Set maximum drawdown limits
- Consider time-based stops for range-bound markets

## Scaling Ladder (System-Proven Path)

This scaling ladder provides a systematic approach to growing account size and exposure as performance metrics are achieved.

| Step | Margin | Leverage | Exposure | Target Profit (5-10%) | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Start | $50 | 5x | $250 | $12-25/month | System sandbox â€” no expectations |
| Step 1 | $100 | 5x | $500 | $25-50/month | Stability check, tiny slippage impact |
| Step 2 | $250 | 5x | $1,250 | $62-125/month | Emotional friction starts here. Four consecutive losses after increasing margin is a stress test |
| Step 3 | $500 | 5x | $2,500 | $125-250/month | Small mistakes start to hurt |
| Step 4 | $1,000 | 5x | $5,000 | $250-500/month | Minimum viable lifestyle begins |
| Step 5 | $2,000 | 5x | $10,000 | $500-1,000/month | System must handle scale stress |
| Step 6 | $5,000 | 5x | $25,000 | $1,250-2,500/month | Tokyo tier, full-time freedom path |

### Progression Guidelines:
- Only move to the next step after consistently achieving target profit for at least one month
- Maintain the same risk parameters as account size increases
- Review and adjust the trading system at each step to ensure it scales appropriately
- Be aware that psychological challenges increase with position size
- System must prove stability before moving to steps where mistakes become costly
- Target profit range represents 5-10% monthly return on exposure amount

### Next Steps
- After successful completion of Step 1 (minimum 2 weeks)
- Review performance metrics
- If criteria are met, consider moving to Step 2
- If criteria are not met, analyze and adjust strategy

### Important Notes
- This is a real money account - treat it with appropriate seriousness
- Keep detailed records of all trades and decisions
- Be prepared to stop and reassess if performance deviates significantly from sandbox results
- Remember that real market conditions may differ from sandbox environment
- With full account usage per trade, position management is critical
- Ensure proper margin maintenance to avoid liquidation
- Fixed 0.7% stop loss means consistent risk per trade 
- Implementation of additional filters reduced trading frequency but significantly improved trade quality by avoiding potential traps
- Despite experiencing 4 consecutive losses, decided to maintain current filter settings to observe system performance without further modifications 
- After several stop losses hit and noticing a numbing of wins, removed the fourth filter to increase trading opportunities
- Current system version: 1.2.1f 
- System performance improved after filter removal - no longer avoiding winning trades
- Currently holding a long position for over 24 hours with positive performance
