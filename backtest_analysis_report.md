## 10. Conclusion

The comprehensive backtest analysis reveals that successful algorithmic trading requires:

No single strategy dominates all market conditions. The optimal approach combines multiple strategies with dynamic allocation based on market regime. Focus on risk-adjusted returns rather than absolute profits, and always maintain strict risk management protocols.

Future success will depend on continuous monitoring, regular rebalancing, and the discipline to stick to systematic rules even during drawdowns.
